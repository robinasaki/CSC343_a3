PART 2

Q1
(a) 
S->U: SUTVXQ
NO R, FAIL
R->SW: RSWUTVXQ
PASS

All fail except R->SW, as R exists only on the LHS of any FD, and only for R->SW.
No other FD can get R (or W) in its closure and therefore produce a superset.

(b)
SELECT S->U
S+ = SUTVXQU
    R1 = SUTVXQ
    R2 = QRSTUVWX - (QSTUVX - S) = QRSTUVWX - QTUVX = RSW
