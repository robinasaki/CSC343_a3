- Item can only be presented once
- attendee type is global across all conferences (e.g. if an attendee is 'student' at one conference, they are 'student' at ALL conferences)
- We don't care (right now) if the person being referenced is actually attending the event in question
- Authors on a submission need not be the same. You can submit work for different organziations (e.g. A Princeton PhD can submit a paper for UofT)
